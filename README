Solutions to FreeFlow (android game)

The initial solution is a brute force method with some minor optimizations.
Produces results in reasonable time for upto 8X8 grids. Takes extremely long
for 9X9 grids and above, and this algorithm is not practical for such grids.
Need to find a better algorithm/optimizations.
